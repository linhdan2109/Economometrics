Regression Result


1. With the model:  
      bwght = β0 + β1 faminc + β2 male + β3 cigs + β4 cigtax + β5 cigprice + u
      
- The OLS regression is
bwght = 114.8178 + 0.0963faminc + 3.0365male – 0.4666cigs + 0.1439cigtax – 0.0179cigprice      (1)
        (11.8974)   (0.0295)       (1.0769)    (0.0914)       (0.1442)	       (0.1102)      
		n = 1388,  R2 = 0.03788
 
 
2. Regression specification error test (RESET)
Let bwght^ denote the OLS fitted values from estimating (1). Use this equation to test whether (1) has missed important nonlinearities:
bwght = 114.8178 + 0.0963faminc + 3.0365male – 0.4666cigs + 0.1439cigtax – 0.0179cigprice + d1.(bwght^)^2 + d2.(bwght^)^3 + error    (2)
Hypothesis:
     H0: d1 = 0, d2 = 0 ( (1) is correctly specified )
     H1: H0 is not true 
The RESET statistic in (2) have p-value = 0.3759 > α=0.05  
Thus, we do not reject H0 at the 5% significance level
We can conclude that the model (1) was not rejected by RESET (at the 5% level)


3. Residual Normality Test (Jarque.Bera test and Shapiro.Wilk test)
Hypothesis:
     H0: residual is normally distributed
     H1: residual is not normally distributed
Result: 
    Jarque-Bera test for normality: p-value < 2.2e-16
    Shapiro-Wilk normality test: p-value = 1.37e-15  
Thus, we reject H0 at the 5% significance level. So, residual is not normally distributed
But because our dataset has a large sample size (1388 observations). 
=> the OLS estimators are normally distributed regardless of the population distribution of u (from Central limit theorem)
=> the T-test and the F-test are still valid
